# Hello, World!

The easiest way to print "Hello, World!"? Genetic programming, of course!

1. Write a brainfuck ([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) 
  or [esolang](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck)) interpreter (see VM.java).
  
2. Use a hillclimber or a genetic algorithm to create a brainfuck that prints "Hello, World!".

Done.

Supplied are, respectively, HillClimberMain and GeneticMain. Note that both supply suboptimal solutions at best and might fail 
at coming up with ANY solution at all (especially the GeneticMain).
